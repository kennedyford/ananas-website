        <h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>
        <p class="about">Ananas was founded by a group of cybersecurity students who recognized the growing threat of wireless attacks and the need for a more comprehensive testing device. Our goal is to create a wireless security testing device that is more advanced and user-friendly than the current offerings on the market.

            Our interest in wireless security stems from our experience in the field and the increasing frequency of attacks on wireless networks. We believe that a more sophisticated testing device is necessary to protect against these threats.
            
            Our team has a shared vision of providing individuals and businesses with a tool to easily test their wireless security measures and identify vulnerabilities. We understand the frustration of dealing with complicated and unreliable devices, which is why we are focused on building a user-friendly and reliable device.
            
            Our R&D efforts are centered around creating a wireless testing device that is both powerful and easy to use. Our device will be designed around the NodeMCU or Raspberry Pi platform and modeled after the Hak5 Wifi Pineapple. We aim to provide a more advanced version of the Pineapple that is capable of identifying even the most sophisticated attacks.
            
            Overall, our goal is to build a better and more effective wireless security testing device to help individuals and businesses protect themselves from the ever-growing threat of wireless attacks.
